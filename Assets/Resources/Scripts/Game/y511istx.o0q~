    Powerups - Have effects on players

    Effects - A list of effects is kept on various objects in the game
        Applying effects - each effect has a lifetime, when the lifetime runs out its effect gets removed
    
    Players - actors for effects to be applied upon

    Lines - actors for effects to be applied upon

    What to do for effect targeting (targets of effects, as in actors of the effects to be applied upon)?
        - Each effect needs to keep a list of actors it will be applied upon within its lifetime

    If there can be multiple effects per actor, how can the effects be tracked (as in if a powerup is already applied to a
    target, how do we keep track of this when another powerup is obtained?)
        answer to the question is 2 parts:
        - keep a list of all running effects
        - keep a list of all actors and within each actor maintain a list of running effects (sort of like a reverse lookup)
        make these 2 parts appear as one system that hides the details, have one central location to create and lookup effects

    class PowerupSystem
        


        SetEffect(actor, effect)

        GetEffect(actor, effect) - return some effect owned by the specified actor

        effect:
            lifetime - number of seconds to run
            endtime - time in which this effect terminates
            actor - actor which this effect applies to
            original - some actor variable reference that stores the original value before modification
            modified - some actor variable reference that is changed to this value during lifetime of effect

            onBegin - method called when the effect begins
            onTerminate - method called when the effect ends
